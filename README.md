Diversity Perspectives in Social Media (DivPSM)

In organizational communication, different perspectives can be identified with regard to management of diversity. Examining the prevalence and development of these perspectives across organizations, sectors, and countries, can reveal much about how views on workplace diversity evolve over time. DivPSM is a digital tool which enables scholars to engage in such research on a large scale. It conducts automated content analysis of corporate social media posts, identifying the presence of three diversity perspectives â€“ the Moral, Market, and Innovation perspectives, based on earlier work by Robin Ely and David Thomas (2001).

DivPSM is a machine learning adaptation of an earlier tool for automated content analysis of diversity perspectives in corporate annual reports (DivPAR) which can be found here: www.github.com/joephofhuis/DivPAR
